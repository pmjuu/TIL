*내가 놓치고 있었던 Python 기초 문법 기록하기*   
# Boolean operations
**The following values are interpreted as false:**   
1. False
2. None
3. numeric zero of all types
4. empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets).

**All other values are interpreted as true.**   
User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a `__bool__()` method.
